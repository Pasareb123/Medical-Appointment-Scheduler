The Clinic Appointment System is a simple console-based application designed to manage patient records and schedule medical appointments efficiently.
The system allows users to add new patients with basic information such as name, age, and phone number, ensuring that each patient is uniquely identified. 
Once patients are registered, appointments can be scheduled for them by specifying the date, time, and reason for the visit.
All data is stored in a JSON file, which allows information to persist between program runs. 
Users can view all registered patients and scheduled appointments at any time, providing an easy way to track clinic activity.
Additionally, the system includes a feature that displays reminders for appointments occurring on the current day, helping both patients and staff stay informed.
The project demonstrates practical use of Python classes, file handling, and basic program flow. 
It is designed for simplicity and ease of use, making it suitable for learning purposes or small-scale clinic management. 
By combining patient and appointment management in a single system, it provides a streamlined way to organize clinic operations while maintaining persistent data storage
